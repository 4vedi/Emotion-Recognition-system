# Emotion-Recognition-system
 </br></br>An Emotion Recognition system recognises human emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised etc from their face using Deep Learning. </br></br>
 It is divided in Three Parts. </br>
 1) Face Detection: The Face is detected using HaarCascade Classifier</br>
 2) Emotion Recognition: Recognition of Emotions on the detected face using Convolution Neural Networks.</br>
 3) Deployment: The Deep Learning part is deployed on a flask website.</br>
 
DataSet: FER Dataset is used to train the emotions.</br>
Main.py is used to run the project. </br>

Final Result: </br>
